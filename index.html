        Dear brothers and sisters My name is Zoheb, I'm 41 years old and from
        Cape Town, South Africa, I haven't done this before so I don't know
        where to start or how to ask, the reason for this is to ask for your
        help, I'm going through a rough time, when COVID affected everyone's
        life, I was at home for 3 months without any income, when I went back to
        work we only worked alternative days and then one week work one week
        off, so income wasn't enough even when we worked full-time income is
        just enough to survive, this whole COVID situation made things difficult
        for me and I couldn't pay my rent and it got quite a big amount, I
        shared a flat with two others guys, they were paying their share but I
        couldn't, but when the situation got better I started paying the owing
        amount every month what I could afford, I used to travel by motorcycle
        to work then it broke and I couldn't fix it because didn't have money to
        fix it, In 2017 I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis which
        affects the whole body but when treatment started then slowly my health
        got better alhamdulillah, medication keeps it in control but it has its
        side effects, I have to visit the doctor from time to time at a
        government Hospital on the given date so I can't just go if there is an
        emergency then I have to go private doctor and they are quite expensive,
        this disease affects the eyes and skin, now recent I got uveitis then
        contacted the hospital but couldn't help so I had to rush to a private
        opthalmologist and explained the situation so the doctor tried to
        contact the hospital to arrange there but they refused to assist so
        didn't have to pay at the private doctor, so the private the doctor
        treated me and charged me slightly less than their actual fee but eye
        drops I had bought from the pharmacy that was also quite expensive, and
        they arranged an appointment at a government Hospital for a future
        check-up, this whole situation created more financial disaster for me,
        now at work also, they are cutting hours so again less income, it was
        already little salary now taking away from that as well, last year I
        started to learn web development to have a better opportunity but that
        also goes slow because the whole country is suffering from load shedding
        (power outages) so whenever I get a chance to learn I learn, this is a
        little part of the whole situation I didn't want to write every single
        detail as no one has time to read, this is the reason I'm asking for
        your help please donate whatever you can if you can't then you just
        share it as much as you can that will do. Please remember in your
        prayers and make dua for me.
